To run the website on a local server:

1. ```npm install``` This installs all the dependencies in the local node_modules folder
2. ```npm run build``` This writes the code to a static Javascript file. You can also ```npm run dev``` to keep watch.
3. ```python manage.py runserver``` This opens up a local server. Run this from /mtsu-collage-website/collagewebsite because you need manage.py
